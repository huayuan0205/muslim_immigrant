				<p>Germany’s history with immigration runs deep, and the public’s 
					opinion of ‘outsiders’ shifts over the decades. In recent years, 
					the Meditteranean has been abuzz since the immigration crisis in 2015, 
					and countries across the globe are still in the midst of legislative 
					and social reform to address the issue.Germany has been steadily progressing 
					over the years, despite political tensions. The country has been a host for 
					many Muslim refugees, for over a century, and the growth of Islamic cultural 
					impact withinin the country has been exponentially growing.

				<p>Lots of Syrian refugees have entered Germany to seek asylum or refugee

					From 2011 through 2016, according to PEW research 86% of the 670,000 
					refugees accepted by Germany were Muslim. It was during the immigrant 
					crisis in 2015 that, as displayed on the bump chart, a sudden influx

				<p>Germany was formally divided into the East and West fractions from 1945

					Germany welcomed 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastarbeiter#West_Germany">“guest workers”</a>
					to fill the employment gaps, including laborers from Turkey in 1961. The Islam culture from Turkey and other

				<p>The trend for immigration into Germany continued into the modern era, 
					with military coups and political unrest in Turkey, Iran, and Lebanon 
					through the 70’s and 80’s significantly increased the number of Muslim 
					persons entering the country under asylum. In 
					<a href="https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/8463/a-brief-history-of-refugees-who-escaped-to-germany">1980</a>
					, Germany had approved over 100,000 refugee applicants in just one year - a staggering record.

			<div class="article" id="para-8">
				<p>It is estimated that over 5.53 million persons in Germany will be practicing Islam by 
					2020. Mosque construction has exponentially increased across the decades, growing 
					from mere handfuls in the early twentieth century, to dozens per year. 
					The interactive Google Map shows the construction of Mosques significantly increased, 
					starting with the 1990’s as tensions in the Middle East rose with international conflict.

				<p>While the labor population in Germany has been steadily increasing overall, 
					according to EuroStat data displayed on the pie charts provided, the largest 
					growth occurs in the foreign-born laborers. Since 2011, the steady incline 
					in foreign-born labor has had the greater percent increase from the years 
					preceding compared to the overall population. This includes Muslim immigrants, 
					which further solidifies their presence in the country.

				<p>As previous generations have settled in Germany, new generations continue to integrate. 
					Their advantage is the pre-established immigrant labor groups. Muslim families who

					enable the expansion of their culture and practices in Germany.

				<p>Halal is essentially the Muslim equivalent to the Jewish practice of

					doctrine in Islam. The abundance of Halal restaurants is a significant 
					indication of the expanse of the Muslim-immigrant culture. The global 
					Muslim information website Zabihah provides numerous counts of Halal 
					restaurants. In 
					<a href="https://www.zabihah.com/sub/Germany/Berlin/AQf3owRxQY">Berlin</a>

				<p>As of 2018, over 40 Mosques have been established in Germany since the turn

				<p>Though the history of immigration into Germany is apparent, there are 
					current political and cultural forces which continue the attraction 
					of Muslims into the country. The Mediterranean sea can be seen as 
					“the entrance to Europe” for many countries undergoing political 
					turmoil and causing mass immigrations.Germany is easily accessible

					immigration legislation.

				<p>A large volume of applications for asylum continue to arrive in Germany, 
					most of which are from Turkey. As depicted on the bump-chart, the Islamic 
					country of Syria’s increase in recent years due the crisis has 
					contributed significantly to the overall intake of Muslim immigrants. 
					The number of immigrants from most of the Mediterranean countries has 
					kept a steady fluctuation since 1990, while there is a dramatic increase

				<p>Not all sentiment for immigration within Germany has been welcoming. 
					In 2014, as tensions with immigrants were building before the crisis 
					burst, the 
					<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegida">Patriotic Europeans Against The Islamisation of the 
					Occident</a>
					- “Pegida” for short - was formed as a “voluntary association” 
					in Germany. The group was established for the main purpose of expressing 
					anti-Islamic sentiments, and advancing their far-right nationalist politics. 
					A recent 
					<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-sees-fewer-attacks-on-muslims-and-mosques-in-2018/a-48156765">
					report</a>
					found that there were 813 Islamophobic crimes counted in Germany 
					in 2018. Even though that’s a slight fall from the number of attacks recorded 
					in 2017 — 950 cases — many see that number as conservative because a lot of 
					"run-of-the-mill attacks, insults and discrimination are not even recorded," 
					said Ulla Jelpke, the Left party's domestic affairs spokesperson in the Bundestag.

				<p>Beyond public groups, there have been anti-immigrant legislators and 
					politicians holding important office positions for Germany, providing validation 
					for public opinions against Muslim immigrants. Horst Seehofer is the current 
					Minister of Germany’s Interior, Building & Community at the cabinet level. 
					Much of his anti-immigrant sentiment became popular during the time of the 
					immigrant crisis, when he resided as Minister-President of the German state 
					of Bavaria, but

			<div class="article" id="para-20">
				<p>Issues with public safety and full integration into German citizenry continue 
					to be a challenge. In August 2018, during a festival celebrating the founding 
					the German city of Chemnitz, a Cuban-German man was killed in a fight. While 
					it seems multiple people were involved, only two Iranian men were named as 
					suspects. This incident inflamed the immigration issues in Germany, and 
					exploded into protests and riots against immigration in Chemnitz.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="article" id="para-21">
				<p>Yet, opposing political views and citizen protests do not entirely deter 
					progress for immigrants. German states have begun to 
					<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/islam-takes-another-step-to-german-recognition/a-16556956">
					adopt Islamic as an official religion</a>
					, which entitles students to be excused from school for 
					religious practices, or for a Muslim adult to request time-off from work with 
					a legally protected reason. This legislation could also help to ensure legal 
					protection from authorities, for Mosques and Muslim-dominated neightborhoods 
					within these states. This German legislation in favor of Islam does not only 
					affect the religious practice; but advances the validity of one’s cultural 
					identity.

				<p>Chancellor Angela Merkel continues to flagship Germany’s progressive moves 
					in regards to immigration. In 2018, the first “Anker” 
					<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/horst-seehofer-demands-angela-merkel-push-for-more-anchor-centers/a-44961813">
					migration transit center</a>
					was opened in Bavaria. Though the center received criticism from 
					Seehofer and his constituents, Chancellor Merkel continues to hold strong 
					to her motto: “we can do this.” Not just as a country providing aid, but 
					as a nation striving to develop relations with immigrants, as Germany 
					reinforces its own economic infrastructure and cultural diversity.
